Implement Frequent pattern analysis using Apriori Algorithm.


Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm refers to the algorithm which is used to calculate the association rules between objects. It means how two or more objects are related to one another. In other words, we can say that the apriori algorithm is an association rule leaning that analyzes that people who bought product A also bought product B.

The primary objective of the apriori algorithm is to create the association rule between different objects. The association rule describes how two or more objects are related to one another. Apriori algorithm is also called frequent pattern mining. Generally, you operate the Apriori algorithm on a database that consists of a huge number of transactions. Let's understand the apriori algorithm with the help of an example; suppose you go to Big Bazar and buy different products. It helps the customers buy their products with ease and increases the sales performance of the Big Bazar.

Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. They try to find out associations between different items and products that can be sold together, which gives assisting in right product placement. Typically, it figures out what products are being bought together and organizations can place products in a similar manner. Letâ€™s understand this better with an example:

People who buy Bread usually buy Butter too. The Marketing teams at retail stores should target customers who buy bread and butter and provide an offer to them so that they buy the third item, like eggs.
